# Testing Guide â€” Model Resolution

Validate provider/model resolution behavior and role handling.

## What to verify
- Provider + bare model yields `provider/model` (e.g., `ollama/llama3.1`).
- Fully-qualified models pass through unchanged (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`).

## Patterns
- Use provided example runners under `examples/research/` in subprocesses to avoid importing heavy stacks in-process.
- Build env with local `PYTHONPATH`, set `NO_NETWORK=1` and `CI=1` for determinism.
